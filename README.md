# The goal of this is to create an inventory management software for NU FAB.

# The user should be able to scan a barcode that lets us take items out of the inventory or put items back into the inventory. 

# Taking items out of the inventory will charge once the task is marked as completed. 
# There are times that are "on hold" and we will only charge if the user does not return the item. 
# and include awaiting payments
